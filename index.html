	<p>
		Hello everybody, I'm Mathilde, firts year student of the ESSEC Global BBA. I love riding horses, traveling and cooking. I launched Le Wagon to learn to code because it is important to know how to create a website !

	<h2> Riding horses </h2>
	<p>
		I am passionnate about horses since I was 3. I have three horses that have stayed at home in Lyon, so I rarely see them since I've been at ESSEC.
	<p> 

	<h2> Travelling </h2>
	<p>
		I have visited many countries, some with my family or friends such as the Canary Islands,Greece, the Spanish islands or Italy others as part of language stays such as Malta or Ireland. I like to travel because I like to discover new cultures, new landscapes, but also to venture into the unknown	<p>

	<h2> Cooking </h2>
	<p>
		I like to gather my friends around a meal.
	<p> 


<h2>My association</h2>
			<p> I'm currently a member of an association in ESSEC. This is EsseCavaliers <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/604960882870513">Facebook</a> which contains 30 people with a passion for horses. We organise two main events each year: the dressage of the grandes écoles and the ESSECJump. We also offer you the opportunity to discover or improve your horse riding skills thanks to courses in partnership with the Chevée stables.<p/>


   <h2>My school career before ESSEC</h2>
   <p>I have a rather atypical background. Indeed, before arriving in this great French business school, I was part of a technological section: the STMG. At the beginning, I had some understandings, because of the clichés we have on technological and professional baccalaureates. The opposite has happened! I, who was not fulfilled in a "classic" curriculum, revealed myself. Business management, law, marketing spoke to me more than physics, French or math. The work of groups also allowed me to open up to others. I even participated in the creation of mini-companies. <p>
